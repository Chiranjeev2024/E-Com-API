 <---------Mongo DB--------->

1. The id generated by the MongoDB id basically 12 byts
    # The first 4 bytes are the time stamp.
    # the next 3 bytes are the machine identifier.
    # the next 2 bytes are the process id
    # And the last 3 bytes are the counter to make the globally unique ID even if the timeStamp and machine identifier as well as process id is same.

2. now the question is how to generate the normal id (Like 1, 2, 3, etc.)
ans-> Steps are the following....

    i) Counter collection (_id:"cartItemId", value:0).
   ii) While adding the cart items, increment the counter and then use counter value as id to cartitem document.
